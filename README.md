What Is My Purpose?

A. To predict the price of a house based on the various factors like lotsize, bedrooms, bathrooms,stories, garage.

How Did I Do This?

A. I have named the columns in the dataframe as lotsize, bedrooms, bathrooms,stories, garage respectively. As it is clear that I need to predict the price, I have made the price as target variable or Y . I have checked the basic EDA process and whether the data is following Normal distribution or not, which is the basic thing to check, to make sure there is no multi collinearity problem. After making sure, I splitted the data into train and test. I have tried to input the data into the linear model and cameout with a prediciton.
